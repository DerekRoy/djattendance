<h2 class="text-center">APPLICATION FOR THE FTTA EXTENSION IN BOSTON</h2>
<h3 class="text-center" style="font-size: 22px;">For {{term}}</h3>
<h4 class="text-center" style="font-size: 18px;">STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</h4>

<p>FTTA-Extension in Boston (FTTA-XB) is a one-year program that supplements and extends training provided by the Full-time Training in Anaheim (FTTA). The burden of FTTA-XB is to produce full-time serving ones who are equipped to serve the Lord for an extended period of time. The primary aspects of this training are the learning of the basic lessons in service and the deeper development of the necessary experiences of life. A secondary but very important aspect of FTTA-XB is to train the young saints to study the truth and read the Bible properly to enable them to apprehend the depths of Godâ€™s revelation progressively over the full course of their serving life.</p>

<p>Graduates of FTTA-XB are currently laboring on college campuses in the United States and Europe, and both destinations are critical for the Lord's present move.</p>
